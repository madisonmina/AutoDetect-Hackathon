## 🌟 Overview

**Innovation Labs Fall 2025** is a collaborative AI competition hosted by the **MSOE AI Club (MAIC)** in partnership with **Xorbix Technologies**, a Milwaukee-based software and AI consulting company.

This semester-long experience challenges students to **design and deliver AI automations for real industries** — with a focus on **Manufacturing, Healthcare, and Insurance Operations**. Participants will work closely with **Xorbix mentors**, gain hands-on experience with **enterprise AI tooling**, and learn to build solutions that bridge technical and business value.

> Whether you’re just starting out or already experienced in machine learning, this is your chance to work on meaningful, production-oriented AI systems.

## 🧠 What Are Innovation Labs?

Innovation Labs are **MAIC’s flagship experiential AI hackathon program**, connecting students with real-world data challenges provided by industry sponsors.

Over the course of two months, teams collaborate on applied AI projects — developing solutions, testing them in enterprise environments, and presenting results to both Xorbix professionals and the MSOE community.

> Think of it as your bridge between classroom learning and real-world AI consulting.
